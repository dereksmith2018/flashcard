              <strong>Javascript JS:</strong>&nbsp;Back in 1995, a developer at Netscape named Brendan Eich introduced JavaScript to the world. Despite Java and JavaScript both containing "Java" in their names, they're two distinct languages that have nothing to do with one another. The official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript which gets its name from the international organization that maintains it, ECMA (European Computer Manufacturer's Association).
              JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. Like HTML and CSS, you do not need to install anything to begin writing JavaScript or see it run on your users' computers. All modern browsers support JavaScript which means JavaScript that you write for your web pages will automatically run when your visitors load your web page in their browsers. In fact, JavaScript is the only scripting language that all browsers support so if you want a page to have dynamic content, learning JavaScript is a must.

            <span class="explanations hide">
              <strong>Operators:</strong>&nbsp;In mathematics and sometimes in computer programming, an operator is a character that represents an action, as for example x is an arithmetic operator that represents multiplication. In computer programs, one of the most familiar sets of operators, the Boolean operators, is used to work with true/false values.

              <strong>Variable naming conventions:</strong>&nbsp;In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

              <strong>Functions:</strong>&nbsp;In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.

            <span class="explanations hide">
              <strong>Methods:</strong>&nbsp;You can think of a method as an action that a number can perform or have taken on it. There is an important difference between a method and a function, but we are not ready to explore this quite yet*. For now, just know that if you did not write the function, it is 99% likely that the function is actually a method. This method is called on a number to change it to exponential form. JavaScript gives a response to this method's call. The response is "4.843278e+4" which is known as the method's return value. In the example above, we call the toExponential() method on the number 48432.78, and the return value is the string "4.843278e+4".

            <span class="explanations hide">
              <strong>Arguments:</strong>&nbsp;Arguments provide a bit more information to methods to help them know what they're supposed to do. In this case, the argument is optional. When a method doesn't take an argument, or when the argument is optional and you aren't using it, you still need the parentheses on the end - so you have to write 1.05e3.toFixed(), not 1.05e3.toFixed.

            <span class="explanations hide">
              <strong>Parameters:</strong>&nbsp;In computer programming, a parameter (often called formal parameter[1] or formal argument) is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine.[a] These pieces of data are the values[2][3][4] of the arguments (often called actual arguments or actual parameters) with which the subroutine is going to be called/invoked. An ordered list of parameters is usually included in the definition of a subroutine, so that, each time the subroutine is called, its arguments for that call are evaluated, and the resulting values can be assigned to the corresponding parameters.

              <strong>Chaining Methods:</strong>&nbsp;Chaining Methods, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.

It is named after George Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century.

              <strong>Undefined:</strong>&nbsp;An undefined variable in the source code of a computer program is a variable that is accessed in the code but has not been previously declared by that code.[1]
              In some programming languages, an implicit declaration is provided the first time such a variable is encountered at compile time. In other languages such a usage is considered to be sufficiently serious that a diagnostic being issued and the compilation fails.
              Some language definitions initially used the implicit declaration behavior and as they matured provided an option to disable it.

When we say it is a library, we mean that many common tasks that would take many, many lines of JavaScript code to execute have been packaged into methods that you'll be able to use with a single line of code. These methods are always available and ready to use the same way you might check out a book at a library. The goal of jQuery is to allow its users to "write less, do more". It's also one of the primary ways we can add interactivity to our sites.

An attribute is frequently and generally a property of a property.
